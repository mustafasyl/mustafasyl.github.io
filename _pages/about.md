 <div style="text-align: justify"> My background is in applied mathematics, and I have extensive research experience in smooth/nonsmooth dynamical systems and mathematical modelling. I have studied models from various fields including mathematical neuroscience, sleep dynamics, mechanical models, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). In my PhD thesis I studied various network models (ranging from mechanics to neuroscience) using dynamical system tools and analysed/visualised simulated data.</div>


 <div style="text-align: justify">Currently, I am working on data analysis, data science, trustworthy and sustainable AI systems, NLP, deep learning, and classical machine learning. I have experience using a multitude of technologies/tools, including but not limited to: Matlab, Julia, SQL, Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker), Streamlit, Tableau, R, Minitab, XPP, Git/Github. </div>
