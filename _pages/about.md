I am a self-motivated, innovative, and solution-oriented person with strong scientific programming and scripting skills. I possess excellent problem-solving and numeracy skills with strong mathematical foundations, which enable me to effectively understand complex methods, algorithms, and statistical tools to interpret data. 

I am passionate about working on dynamical systems, mathematical modelling, data analysis, trustworthy and sustainable AI systems, NLP, deep learning, and classical machine learning. I have experience using a multitude of technologies/tools, including but not limited to: Matlab, Julia, SQL, Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker), Streamlit, Tableau, R, Minitab, XPP, Git/Github.

My background is in applied mathematics, and I have extensive research experience in various fields including mathematical neuroscience, sleep dynamics, mechanical models, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). I completed a PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Nottingham and studied various network models (ranging from mechanics to neuroscience) using dynamical system tools and analysed/visualised simulated data.
